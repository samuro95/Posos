# Posos data challenge

Millions of questions are asked every year about drugs. There is a limited number of query types but the same question could be asked in many ways. Therefore, understanding what information people expect when asking a question is a great challenge. The goal of Posos’ challenge is to predict for each question its associated intent.

Given a set of questions about medication problems, predict the sub-domain (category) of question in order to clarify the intent of the query. Formally, the problem is a text classification problem where texts are a set of phrase and the categories are 52 intentions designed by professional pharmacologists.

Video of the challenge's presentation at Collège de France is available at: https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/stephane-mallat/Challenge-2017-2018-Reponses-a-des-questions-pharmaceutiques-par-Posos.htm.
